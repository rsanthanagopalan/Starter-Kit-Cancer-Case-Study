# Starter-Kit-Cancer-Case-Study

> Background: Melanoma is the deadliest and most aggressive form of skin cancer; it is projected that in 2018, Melanoma of the skin will cause 9,320 deaths in the United States. However, if Melanoma is caught in an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is about 99%. Therefore, the early detection of Melanoma, before metastasis, is critical for patient survival.

## General Information
> Problem: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
> Goal: Identify and classify image records at risk/showing earlier signs of melanoma using a training dataset of images. Solve for class imbalances, if any.Â

## Conclusions
> Analysis: 
- Dataset has class imbalances in images
- Augmentor library used to solve for class imbalances
- Accuracy improved through addition of new layers
